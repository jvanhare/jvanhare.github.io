  abstract = {This work deals with high-order numerical methods for unsteady flows
              around complex geometries. In order to cope with the low-order industrial
              Finite Volume Method, the proposed technique consists in computing
              on structured and unstructured zones with their associated schemes:
              this is called a hybrid approach. Structured and unstructured meshes are then
              coupled by a nonconforming grid interface. The latter is analyzed in details
              with special focus on unsteady flows. It is shown that a dedicated treatment
              at the interface avoids the reflection of spurious waves.
              Moreover, this hybrid approach is validated on several academic test cases
              for both convective and diffusive fluxes. The extension of this hybrid approach
              to high-order schemes is limited by the efficiency of unstructured high-order schemes
              in terms of computational time. This is why a new approach is explored:
              The Spectral Difference Method. A new framework is especially developed to perform
              the spectral analysis of Spectral Discontinuous Methods.
              The Spectral Difference Method seems to be a viable alternative in terms of
              computational time and number of points per wavelength needed
              for a given application to capture the flow physics.}

  abstract = {The spectral analysis is a basic tool to characterise the behaviour of
              any convection scheme. By nature, the solution projected onto the Fourier basis
              enables to estimate the dissipation and the dispersion associated with the spatial
              discretisation of the hyperbolic linear problem. In this paper, we wish to revisit
              such analysis, focusing attention on two key points. The first point concerns
              the effects of time integration on the spectral analysis. 
              It is shown with standard high-order Finite Difference schemes dedicated to
              aeroacoustics that the time integration has an effect on the required number
              of points per wavelength. The situation depends on the choice of the coupled
              schemes (one for time integration, one for space derivative and one for the filter)
              and here, the compact scheme with its eighth-order filter seems to have a better
              spectral accuracy than the considered dispersion-relation preserving scheme with its
              associated filter, especially in terms of dissipation. Secondly, such a coupled
              space–time approach is applied to the new class of high-order spectral
              discontinuous approaches, focusing especially on the Spectral Difference method.
              A new way to address the specific spectral behaviour of the scheme is introduced first
              for wavenumbers in [0,\pi], following the Matrix Power method. For wavenumbers
              above \pi, an aliasing phenomenon always occurs but it is possible to understand
              and to control the aliasing of the signal. It is shown that aliasing depends on
              the polynomial degree and on the number of time steps. A new way to define
              dissipation and dispersion is introduced and applied to wavenumbers larger than \pi.
              Since the new criteria recover the previous results for wavenumbers below \pi,
              the new proposed approach is an extension of all the previous ones dealing
              with dissipation and dispersion errors. At last, since the standard Finite Difference
              schemes can serve as reference solution for their capability in aeroacoustics,
              it is shown that the Spectral Difference method is as accurate as
              (or even more accurate) than the considered Finite Difference schemes.}

              on a nonconforming grid interface between two structured blocks for the
              two-dimensional advection equation, in a cell-centered finite-volume formalism.
              The conservative flux computation on the nonconforming grid interface 
              is based on the sum of partial fluxes computed with the same numerical scheme
              used for a standard cell interface. This framework is used to analyze the effect
              of grid refinement or coarsening on the stability of the second-order centered
              scheme. New theoretical results are given and compared to numerical results.
              Considering the convection of a two-dimensional isentropic vortex,
              the refinement/coarsening are shown to be the cause of instabilities,
              poor accuracy and reflection of high-frequency waves.
              A new approach to compute partial fluxes, which is based both on a high-order
              extrapolation that accounts for the local metric and on a Riemann solver,
              is then proposed to reduce spurious modes.}

  abstract  = {In the context of mesh adaptation for CFD simulations,
               some phenomena or numerical schemes require the mesh to be structured,
               while respecting some alignment constraints e.g. boundary layers. 
               Since full-hexahedra or full-quadrilaterals mesh generation methods cannot
               fulfil such requirements so far, we propose to use hybrid meshes,
               i.e. meshes containing both structured and unstructured elements.
               Accordingly, the following work focuses on hybrid metric-based mesh
               adaptation and CFD simulation on such meshes.
               Regarding hybrid mesh generation, the method relies on a preliminary mesh
               obtained through the so-called metric-orthogonal approach.
               These approaches utilize the directional information held by a prescribed
               metric-field to generate right angled elements, that can be combined into
               structured elements to form a hybrid mesh. The result highly depends on
               the quality of the metric field. Thus, emphasis is put on the size gradation
               control performed beforehand. This process is re-designed to favor
               metric-orthogonal meshes. To validate the method, some CFD simulations
               are performed. The modifications brought to an existing Finite Volume solver
               to enable such computations are detailed in this paper.}

  abstract     = {During the last decade, the Moore's law has proven to be outdated.
                  The computational power does not double anymore every year for a given cost
                  under the pursuit of the energy efficiency.
                  To address this issue, the High Performance Computing (HPC) industry showed
                  an incredible ingenuity by designing complex architectures.
                  Today, the HPC tends to have more and more cores on each node,
                  possibly with accelerators like General-Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU)
                  or Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), and with less and less memory.
                  As a corollary, the developers of scientific computing software
                  need to pay attention and master numerous key concepts,
                  which require great expertise, to hope to extract a reasonable performance.
                  These key concepts include programming on heterogeneous architectures,
                  multithreading programming, Message Passage Interface (MPI) programming,
                  load balancing, asynchronous and non-blocking communications,
                  cache blocking techniques, vectorization or even parallel Input/Output (I/O).
                  It is in this context that the ParaDiGM library was created to provide
                  the developers a progressive framework, which consists of a set
                  of low-, mid- and high-level services usable by many developers
                  of scientific computing software that rely on a mesh, typically when
                  solving partial differential equations on a given domain.
                  The ParaDiGM kernel is based on the key concept of a distributed or
                  partitioned view of data stored in an array.
                  After introducing ParaDiGM and giving some general information in the
                  first section, we shall attach great importance in the second section
                  to describe in details the distributed and
                  the partitioned approaches and their impact on parallel algorithms.
                  For instance, we will show that the partitioned view is not always well suited
                  for parallel algorithms and that the distributed view,
                  even though less intuitive, is better suited for specific algorithms.
                  New MPI communication protocols have been developed to switch from one view to the other.
                  Then, we will present parallel dedicated algorithms
                  for wall distance computation in the third section and isosurfaces computations
                  in the fourth section.
                  In each section, some applications will be shown with a special emphasis
                  on the parallel computational efficiency on several thousand cores.},

  abstract     = {Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) entered the aerospace industry some decades ago.
                  During the last 20 years, the focus was mainly on increasing solver robustness
                  and accuracy. However, obvious as it may be, no mesh implies no solution and
                  the latter depends on the mesh quality. Indeed, mesh and solution should be seen
                  as a couple. The numerical schemes and the mesh generation methods have
                  to be tightly linked. A very efficient approach to address these challenges
                  is the anisotropic unstructured mesh adaptation and the vertex-centered
                  Mixed Finite Element Finite Volume (MFEFV) method. First of all, an emphasis
                  is put on the theory of anisotropic unstructured meshes and error estimates
                  for steady and unsteady flow simulations. The cavity operator,
                  including its non-manifold version, is then presented to obtain,
                  strictly speaking, the anisotropic mesh. To conclude with the theoretical aspects,

                  Finally, this whole framework is illustrated by two major applications:
                  a fluid-structure interaction problem dealing with an elastic panel in shock tube
                  and the C608 low boom flight demonstrator test case from the

  abstract     = {The fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems deal with the interaction between
                  structures and fluid flow. They are present in many domains among aeroelastics,
                  flutter and bioengineering. Since the last decades, the computational resources had
                  significantly increased allowing the computation of challenging FSI problems.
                  However, the computational restitution time is still a key point for the industry,
                  specially when dealing with multi-physics simulations. In this work, we proposed
                  to demonstrate the efficiency of mesh adaptation to solve unsteady fluid-structure
                  interaction problems. The Navier-Stokes equations are solved by an edge-based
                  Finite Volume solver whereas the linear elasticity equation is solved by
                  the Finite Element Method using the Lagrange $P^1$ elements.
                  The coupling between both solvers is realized with boundary conditions.
                  The assumption of small displacement is made in this work leading to small strain.
                  Therefore, the mesh is not deformed and an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE)
                  formulation for the Navier-Stokes equations is not needed.
                  For the unsteady mesh adaptation, the algorithm developed by Barral et al.
                  is used to adapt the flow mesh. The flow metric is then propagated to structure mesh
                  to adapt it by metric gradation. FSI problems are very complex to solve due
                  to nonlinearities and its multi-physic aspect.
                  Few analytical solutions are available. It is why, in this work, we decided
                  to treat a well-documented problem, namely the elastic panel in a shock tube
                  developed by Giordano et al.
                  Finally, we also plan to carry out simulations of three-dimensional complex cases.}

                  a given mesh refinement. In this work, we wish to revisit such analysis
                  focusing attention on the SpectralDifference method.
                  First, using a space/time analysis, a new way to address the specific spectral
                  behaviour of the scheme is introduced for wavenumbers in [0, \pi],
                  following the matrix power method. For wavenumbers above \pi, an aliasing phenomenon
                  always occurs but it is now possible to understand and to control
                  the aliasing of the signal. It is shown that aliasing depends on the polynomial
                  degree and on the number of time steps. A new way to define dissipation and
                  dispersion is introduced and applied to wavenumbers larger than \pi.
                  Since thenew criteria recover the previous results for wavenumbers below \pi,
                  the new approach is an extension of all the previous ones for analysing dissipation
                  and dispersion. To conclude, the proposed analysis revisits the spectral analysis
                  first introduced by Van den Abeele and gives new explanations regarding
                  the spectral behaviour. The new spectral analysis leads to results
                  that differ from the ones published in previous studies but the mathematical
                  framework introduced in the presentation is well-posed and
                  confirmed by numerical simulations.}

                  wavelength with a given mesh refinement. This presentation follows the one
                  entitled Revisiting the spectral analysis for high-order spectral discontinuous
                  methods. In the first presentation, a new theoretical framework was introduced to
                  explain the spectral behaviour of the spectral difference scheme.
                  Here, we wish to compare the accuracy of the spectral difference scheme and the one
                  for standard finite difference schemes applied to aeroacoustics.
                  Such an analysis is a prerequisite to show that the spectral resolution
                  of the spectral difference method is in strong agreement with the spectral
                  resolution of well-established schemes for aeroacoustics. In practice, the two
                  standard finite difference schemes (applied to aeroacoustics) are the 6th order
                  compact scheme of Lele and a 4th order DRP scheme developed by Bogey and Bailly.
                  They are coupled with their relative filters and with a low-dissipation
                  low-dispersion time integration procedure. It is finally shown that the
                  Spectral Difference method is as accurate as (or even more accurate) than
                  the considered Finite Difference schemes. As a consequence, the Spectral
                  Difference approach is a good candidate to perform accurate unsteady
                  Large Eddy Simulations.}

                  to compare with solutions obtained by the elsA software. The nonconforming grid

                  responsible for instabilities in the form of reflection of high-frequency waves
                  at the nonconforming grid interface. This problem is solved using a high order
