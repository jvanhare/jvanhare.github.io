# About

Since october 2022, I am a research fellow in the [GAMMA](https://team.inria.fr/gamma) team
at [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en), which is aimed at certifying the numerical results and
providing high-fidelity numerical solutions. It focuses on state-of-the-art meshing technologies
and advanced numerical methods.

My research interests lie in numerical methods and tools for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).
I am working on high-order and high-fidelity numerical methods and high-order anisotropic
mesh adaptation to perform Large Eddy Simulation around complex geometries.
