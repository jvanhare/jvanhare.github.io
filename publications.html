In order to cope with the low-order industrial Finite Volume Method, the proposed technique consists in computing on structured and unstructured zones with their associated schemes: this is called a hybrid approach. Structured and unstructured meshes are then coupled by a nonconforming grid interface. The latter is analyzed in details with special focus on unsteady flows. It is shown that a dedicated treatment at the interface avoids the reflection of spurious waves. Moreover, this hybrid approach is validated on several academic test cases for both convective and diffusive fluxes. The extension of this hybrid approach to high-order schemes is limited by the efficiency of unstructured high-order schemes in terms of computational time. This is why a new approach is explored: The Spectral Difference Method. A new framework is especially developed to perform the spectral analysis of Spectral Discontinuous Methods. The Spectral Difference Method seems to be a viable alternative in terms of computational time and number of points per wavelength needed for a given application to capture the flow physics.","author":[{"given":"Julien","family":"Vanharen"}],"type":"thesis","genre":"phdthesis","id":"vanharen_phd","citation-key":"vanharen_phd","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,5]]},"keyword":"Finite Volume,Nonconforming Grid Interface,Hybrid Approach,High-Order Unstructured Schemes,Spurious Waves,Spectral Difference,Spectral Analysis","title":"High-Order Numerical Methods For Unsteady Flows Around Complex Geometries","URL":"https://jvanhare.github.io/pdf/vanharen_phd.pdf"},{"container-title":"J.

Comput. Phys.","abstract":"The spectral analysis is a basic tool to characterise the behaviour of any convection scheme. By nature, the solution projected onto the Fourier basis enables to estimate the dissipation and the dispersion associated with the spatial discretisation of the hyperbolic linear problem. In this paper, we wish to revisit such analysis, focusing attention on two key points. The first point concerns the effects of time integration on the spectral analysis. It is shown with standard high-order Finite Difference schemes dedicated to aeroacoustics that the time integration has an effect on the required number of points per wavelength. The situation depends on the choice of the coupled schemes (one for time integration, one for space derivative and one for the filter) and here, the compact scheme with its eighth-order filter seems to have a better spectral accuracy than the considered dispersion-relation preserving scheme with its associated filter, especially in terms of dissipation. Secondly, such a coupled space–time approach is applied to the new class of high-order spectral discontinuous approaches, focusing especially on the Spectral Difference method. A new way to address the specific spectral behaviour of the scheme is introduced first for wavenumbers in [0,π], following the Matrix Power method. For wavenumbers above π, an aliasing phenomenon always occurs but it is possible to understand and to control the aliasing of the signal. It is shown that aliasing depends on the polynomial degree and on the number of time steps. A new way to define dissipation and dispersion is introduced and applied to wavenumbers larger than π. Since the new criteria recover the previous results for wavenumbers below π, the new proposed approach is an extension of all the previous ones dealing with dissipation and dispersion errors. At last, since the standard Finite Difference schemes can serve as reference solution for their capability in aeroacoustics, it is shown that the Spectral Difference method is as accurate as (or even more accurate) than the considered Finite Difference schemes.","author":[{"given":"Julien","family":"Vanharen"},{"given":"Guillaume","family":"Puigt"},{"given":"Xavier","family":"Vasseur"},{"given":"Jean-François","family":"Boussuge"},{"given":"Pierre","family":"Sagaut"}],"DOI":"10.1016/j.jcp.2017.02.043","type":"article-journal","id":"vanharen_jcp_337_2017","citation-key":"vanharen_jcp_337_2017","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,5]]},"keyword":"Space-time spectral analysis,Spectral discontinuous,Finite Difference,Aeroacoustics,Aliasing,Matrix Power Method","page":"379-402","title":"Revisiting the spectral analysis for high-order spectral discontinuous methods","volume":"337"},{"container-title":"J.

Accordingly, the following work focuses on hybrid metric-based mesh adaptation and CFD simulation on such meshes. Regarding hybrid mesh generation, the method relies on a preliminary mesh obtained through the so-called metric-orthogonal approach. These approaches utilize the directional information held by a prescribed metric-field to generate right angled elements, that can be combined into structured elements to form a hybrid mesh. The result highly depends on the quality of the metric field. Thus, emphasis is put on the size gradation control performed beforehand. This process is re-designed to favor metric-orthogonal meshes.

The computational power does not double anymore every year for a given cost under the pursuit of the energy efficiency. To address this issue, the High Performance Computing (HPC) industry showed an incredible ingenuity by designing complex architectures. Today, the HPC tends to have more and more cores on each node, possibly with accelerators like General-Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) or Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), and with less and less memory. As a corollary, the developers of scientific computing software need to pay attention and master numerous key concepts, which require great expertise, to hope to extract a reasonable performance. These key concepts include programming on heterogeneous architectures, multithreading programming, Message Passage Interface (MPI) programming, load balancing, asynchronous and non-blocking communications, cache blocking techniques, vectorization or even parallel Input/Output (I/O). It is in this context that the ParaDiGM library was created to provide the developers a progressive framework, which consists of a set of low-, mid- and high-level services usable by many developers of scientific computing software that rely on a mesh, typically when solving partial differential equations on a given domain. The ParaDiGM kernel is based on the key concept of a distributed or partitioned view of data stored in an array. After introducing ParaDiGM and giving some general information in the first section, we shall attach great importance in the second section to describe in details the distributed and the partitioned approaches and their impact on parallel algorithms. For instance, we will show that the partitioned view is not always well suited for parallel algorithms and that the distributed view, even though less intuitive, is better suited for specific algorithms. New MPI communication protocols have been developed to switch from one view to the other. Then, we will present parallel dedicated algorithms for wall distance computation in the third section and isosurfaces computations in the fourth section. In each section, some applications will be shown with a special emphasis on the parallel computational efficiency on several thousand cores.","author":[{"given":"Eric","family":"Quémerais"},{"given":"Bastien","family":"Andrieu"},{"given":"Bruno","family":"Maugars"},{"given":"Julien","family":"Coulet"},{"given":"Stéphanie","family":"Lala"},{"given":"Julien","family":"Vanharen"}],"type":"document","id":"vanharen_odas_2022","citation-key":"vanharen_odas_2022","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,6]]},"keyword":"High Performance Computing (HPC),Message Passing Interface (MPI),Massively parallel,Distributed/Partitioned approaches,Unstructured meshes,Partial Differential Equation simulation,Wall distance,Isosurface.","publisher":"22\u003csup\u003end\u003c/sup\u003e ONERA-DLR Aerospace Symposium, ODAS 2022","title":"ParaDiGM: a library to handle Parallel Distributed General Meshes","URL":"https://jvanhare.github.io/pdf/vanharen_odas_2022.pdf"},{"publisher-place":"Le Barp, France","abstract":"Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) entered the aerospace industry some decades ago.

Since the last decades, the computational resources had significantly increased allowing the computation of challenging FSI problems. However, the computational restitution time is still a key point for the industry, specially when dealing with multi-physics simulations. In this work, we proposed to demonstrate the efficiency of mesh adaptation to solve unsteady fluid-structure interaction problems. The Navier-Stokes equations are solved by an edge-based Finite Volume solver whereas the linear elasticity equation is solved by the Finite Element Method using the Lagrange P¹ elements. The coupling between both solvers is realized with boundary conditions. The assumption of small displacement is made in this work leading to small strain. Therefore, the mesh is not deformed and an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation for the Navier-Stokes equations is not needed. For the unsteady mesh adaptation, the algorithm developed by Barral et al. is used to adapt the flow mesh. The flow metric is then propagated to structure mesh to adapt it by metric gradation. FSI problems are very complex to solve due to nonlinearities and its multi-physic aspect. Few analytical solutions are available. It is why, in this work, we decided to treat a well-documented problem, namely the elastic panel in a shock tube developed by Giordano et al. Finally, we also plan to carry out simulations of three-dimensional complex cases.","author":[{"given":"Julien","family":"Vanharen"},{"given":"Rémi","family":"Feuillet"},{"given":"Frédéric","family":"Alauzet"}],"type":"document","id":"vanharen_eccomas_2018","citation-key":"vanharen_eccomas_2018","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,6]]},"publisher":"6\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e European Conference on Computational Mechanics (ECCM 6). 7\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e European Conference on Computational Fluid Dynamics (ECFD 7)","title":"Mesh adaptation for fluid-structure interaction problems","URL":"https://jvanhare.github.io/pdf/vanharen_eccomas_2018.pdf"},{"publisher-place":"Toulouse, France","abstract":"The spectral analysis is a basic tool to characterise the behaviour of any convection scheme.

Such an approach is the prerequisite to define the associated Points Per Wavelength (PPW) for capturing the solution wavelengthwith a given mesh refinement. In this work, we wish to revisit such analysis focusing attention on the SpectralDifference method. First, using a space/time analysis, a new way to address the specific spectral behaviour of the scheme is introduced for wavenumbers in [0, π], following the matrix power method. For wavenumbers above π, an aliasing phenomenon always occurs but it is now possible to understand and to control the aliasing of the signal. It is shown that aliasing depends on the polynomial degree and on the number of time steps. A new way to define dissipation and dispersion is introduced and applied to wavenumbers larger than π. Since thenew criteria recover the previous results for wavenumbers below π, the new approach is an extension of all the previous ones for analysing dissipation and dispersion. To conclude, the proposed analysis revisits the spectral analysis first introduced by Van den Abeele and gives new explanations regarding the spectral behaviour. The new spectral analysis leads to results that differ from the ones published in previous studies but the mathematical framework introduced in the presentation is well-posed and confirmed by numerical simulations.","author":[{"given":"Julien","family":"Vanharen"},{"given":"Guillaume","family":"Puigt"},{"given":"Xavier","family":"Vasseur"},{"given":"Jean-François","family":"Boussuge"},{"given":"Pierre","family":"Sagaut"}],"type":"document","id":"vanharen_tilda_first_2016","citation-key":"vanharen_tilda_first_2016","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,11]]},"publisher":"TILDA - Symposium \u0026 Workshop on Industrial LES \u0026 DNS","title":"Revisiting the spectral analysis for high-order spectral discontinuous methods","URL":"https://jvanhare.github.io/pdf/vanharen_tilda_first_2016.pdf"},{"publisher-place":"Toulouse, France","abstract":"The spectral analysis is a basic tool to characterise the behaviour of any convection scheme.

This presentation follows the one entitled Revisiting the spectral analysis for high-order spectral discontinuous methods. In the first presentation, a new theoretical framework was introduced to explain the spectral behaviour of the spectral difference scheme. Here, we wish to compare the accuracy of the spectral difference scheme and the one for standard finite difference schemes applied to aeroacoustics. Such an analysis is a prerequisite to show that the spectral resolution of the spectral difference method is in strong agreement with the spectral resolution of well-established schemes for aeroacoustics. In practice, the two standard finite difference schemes (applied to aeroacoustics) are the 6th order compact scheme of Lele and a 4th order DRP scheme developed by Bogey and Bailly. They are coupled with their relative filters and with a low-dissipation low-dispersion time integration procedure. It is finally shown that the Spectral Difference method is as accurate as (or even more accurate) than the considered Finite Difference schemes. As a consequence, the Spectral Difference approach is a good candidate to perform accurate unsteady Large Eddy Simulations.","author":[{"given":"Julien","family":"Vanharen"},{"given":"Guillaume","family":"Puigt"},{"given":"Xavier","family":"Vasseur"},{"given":"Jean-François","family":"Boussuge"},{"given":"Pierre","family":"Sagaut"}],"type":"document","id":"vanharen_tilda_second_2016","citation-key":"vanharen_tilda_second_2016","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,11]]},"publisher":"TILDA - Symposium \u0026 Workshop on Industrial LES \u0026 DNS","title":"Comparing the resolution power of standard finite difference and spectral difference schemes","URL":"https://jvanhare.github.io/pdf/vanharen_tilda_second_2016.pdf"},{"publisher-place":"Toulouse, France","abstract":"A general framework is proposed to study the unsteady behaviour of nonconforming grid interface between two structured blocks. Using the Finite Volume Method, a two-dimensional spectral analysis is performed for a second order centred scheme to compare with solutions obtained by the elsA software. The nonconforming grid interface makes possible to coarse/refine each block, which is not without effect on both stability and accuracy of the unsteady solution. High coarsening is responsible for instabilities in the form of reflection of high-frequency waves at the nonconforming grid interface. This problem is solved using a high order interpolation, which depends on metric, and a Riemann solver.","author":[{"given":"Julien","family":"Vanharen"},{"given":"Guillaume","family":"Puigt"},{"given":"Marc","family":"Montagnac"}],"type":"document","id":"vanharen_3af_2015","citation-key":"vanharen_3af_2015","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,4]]},"publisher":"50\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e 3AF International Conference on Applied Aerodynamics","title":"Two-dimensional spectral analysis of nonconforming grid interface.
